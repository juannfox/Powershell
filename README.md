# Powershell scripts

## tl;dr
Just a collection of useful **Powershell** scripts I've used over the years.
Most of them are meant for **Powershell 7**, but likely run on **Windows Powershell 5.1**. 
Some might require *context*, so pay attention to the comments (e.g. A script meant to be run within an Azure Automation Account).
